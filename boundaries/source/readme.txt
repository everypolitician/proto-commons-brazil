- Geographical regions
The urban concentrations are defined as Isolated Municipalities and Population Arrangement, both with population over 100 000 inhabitants. These arrangements present a high degree of integration between the component municipalities, in particular with the nucleus, having a large population size and may have urbanization spots that result from the expansion of one or more cities, forming conurbations with varied forms.

- Immediate Geographical Regions

The Immediate Geographical Regions (RGI) have in the urban network their main reference element. RGIs are structures from nearby urban centers to meet the immediate needs of populations, such as purchases of durable and non-durable consumer goods, job search, health and education services, and the provision of public services , such as INSS, Ministry of Labor and Employment and Judiciary posts, among others.
